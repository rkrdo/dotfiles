# Set personal aliases, overriding those provided by oh-my-zsh libs,
# plugins, and themes. Aliases can be placed here, though oh-my-zsh
# users are encouraged to define aliases within the ZSH_CUSTOM folder.
# For a full list of active aliases, run `alias`.

# Example aliases
# alias zshconfig="mate ~/.zshrc"
# alias ohmyzsh="mate ~/.oh-my-zsh"
alias zshconfig="vim ~/.zshrc"
alias sourcezsh="source ~/.zshrc"

#git
alias gdcnp='git --no-pager diff --cached'
alias gh='git hist'
